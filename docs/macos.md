# Question: Does macos have a maximum amount of files that can be added to a folder where things like mdworker_shared start causing issues for the OS?

While macOS does not have a strict technical limit on the number of files that can be added to a folder, there are practical limitations that can cause performance issues when dealing with an extremely large number of files in a single directory. Here's what you need to know:

## File System Limitations

APFS (Apple File System), which is the default file system for macOS, has a theoretical limit of billions of files per directory[1]. However, real-world performance can be significantly impacted well before reaching this limit.

## Performance Issues

As the number of files in a folder increases, several performance issues can arise:

1. **Finder Slowdowns**: The Finder may become sluggish or unresponsive when trying to display folders with hundreds of thousands of files[3][4].

2. **Indexing Problems**: Spotlight, which uses the mdworker_shared process, can struggle with indexing extremely large directories[2].

3. **CPU and RAM Usage**: The mdworker_shared process may consume excessive CPU and RAM when dealing with folders containing a very large number of files[2].

4. **File Operations**: Basic operations like copying, moving, or deleting files can become time-consuming and resource-intensive.

## Practical Considerations

While there's no fixed number, issues typically start to become noticeable when dealing with:

- Folders containing 100,000 to 300,000 files[3]
- Directories approaching or exceeding 1 million files[5]

## Best Practices

To avoid performance issues:

1. **Use Subfolders**: Break up large collections of files into smaller subfolders, ideally containing no more than 10,000 to 25,000 files each[3].

2. **Avoid Finder for Large Directories**: Use command-line tools or specialized applications for managing folders with an extremely high number of files[3].

3. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Keep an eye on CPU and RAM usage, especially for processes like mdworker_shared[2].

4. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically clean up and organize your files to prevent accumulation of unnecessary items.

5. **Consider File Size**: While the number of files is important, the total size of the files in a directory can also impact performance[4].

By following these practices, you can help ensure that macOS and its various processes, including mdworker_shared, continue to function efficiently even when dealing with large numbers of files.
